4-bit ALU Design and Simulation in VHDL
Project Overview
This repository contains the VHDL implementation of a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), a fundamental component of digital systems capable of performing arithmetic and logical operations. The project includes a comprehensive testbench to verify functionality, making it a valuable demonstration of digital design and verification skills for VLSI engineering.
Features

Operations Supported:
Arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction
Logical: AND, OR, XOR, NOT


Inputs:
Two 4-bit operands (A, B)
3-bit operation select signal (OP)


Outputs:
4-bit result (Result)
Zero flag (Zero) set to '1' when the result is "0000"


Optimization: Designed with a focus on modularity and efficient logic implementation.
Verification: Includes a testbench covering all operations with assertions for automated output checking.

Files

ALU_4bit.vhd: VHDL code for the 4-bit ALU entity and architecture.
ALU_4bit_tb.vhd: Testbench for simulating and verifying the ALU's functionality.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To simulate this project, you need a VHDL simulator. Recommended tools:

ModelSim (commercial, industry-standard)
Vivado Simulator (free with Xilinx Vivado, ideal for FPGA synthesis)
GHDL (free, open-source, pair with GTKWave for waveforms)
EDA Playground (free, browser-based, no installation needed)

Simulation Instructions

Using EDA Playground (Online):
Navigate to EDA Playground.
Create a new project and select VHDL as the language.
Upload ALU_4bit.vhd and ALU_4bit_tb.vhd.
Choose a simulator (e.g., ModelSim or GHDL).
Set simulation time to at least 70 ns.
Run the simulation and view waveforms or console output.


Using Local Tools (e.g., ModelSim):
Open ModelSim or your preferred tool.
Compile both ALU_4bit.vhd and ALU_4bit_tb.vhd.
Start simulation with the testbench (ALU_4bit_tb).
Run for 70 ns to cover all test cases.
View waveforms for A, B, OP, Result, and Zero.


Verification:
The testbench includes assertions to check outputs.

Expected results:

| Test Case                 | A    | B    | OP  | Expected Result | Zero |
|---------------------------|------|------|-----|-----------------|------|
| Addition (3 + 1)          | 0011 | 0001 | 000 | 0100            | 0    |
| Subtraction (4 - 2)       | 0100 | 0010 | 001 | 0010            | 0    |
| AND (1100 AND 1010)       | 1100 | 1010 | 010 | 1000            | 0    |
| OR (1100 OR 1010)         | 1100 | 1010 | 011 | 1110            | 0    |
| XOR (1100 XOR 1010)       | 1100 | 1010 | 100 | 0110            | 0    |
| NOT (NOT 1100)            | 1100 | 0000 | 101 | 0011            | 0    |
| Zero flag test (2 - 2)    | 0010 | 0010 | 001 | 0000            | 1    |

Achievements

Implemented a modular 4-bit ALU supporting six operations.
Developed a robust testbench with 100% test coverage for all operations.
Optimized design for clarity and efficient logic utilization.
Successfully simulated using [Tool, e.g., ModelSim], verifying correct functionality and Zero flag behavior.

Future Improvements

Add support for additional operations (e.g., shift, increment).
Optimize for area and power by reducing gate count or switching activity.
Extend to 8-bit or 16-bit ALU for scalability.
Synthesize and implement on an FPGA (e.g., Xilinx Spartan-6).
